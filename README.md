# Test the Sample

Apart from exploring the sample code base in GitHub, you can also clone and run the sample in your preferred AppBuilder client.

## In-Browser

With the AppBuilder in-browser client, you can develop hybrid and NativeScript cross-platform mobile apps from your browser. You can use the in-browser client at [https://platform.telerik.com](https://platform.telerik.com).

### Clone the sample

1. Click the button at the top of this document.
1. Provide your login credentials, if prompted.

### Run the sample

* [Run in the companion app.][companion]
* [Deploy on device via QR code.][QR code]

## Universal

With the AppBuilder universal desktop client, you can develop hybrid and NativeScript cross-platform mobile apps from your desktop (OS X or Windows). You can download and install the universal desktop client from [https://platform.telerik.com/appbuilder/webclient/#/downloads](https://platform.telerik.com/appbuilder/webclient/#/downloads).

### Clone the sample

1. Click **Create app**.
1. Click **Advanced**.
1. Select **Clone repository**.
1. Enter `https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/Toast-DemoApp.git` in the **Repository URI** text box.
1. Provide an app name.
1. (Optional) Provide description.
1. Click **Create app** and wait for the in-browser client to load the app.

A new app is added in your Telerik Platform account and all files are checked into the integrated AppBuilder version control. Third-party version control is configured and your app is connected to the repository from which you cloned it. The universal desktop client opens the code for your new app and lists all app files in the Project Navigator.

### Run the sample

* [Run in the companion app.][companion]
* [Deploy on device via QR code.][QR code]
* [Deploy via cable connection.][USB deploy]

## Windows

With the AppBuilder Windows client, you can develop hybrid and NativeScript cross-platform mobile apps from your Windows desktop. You can download and install the Windows client from [http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder/windows-client](http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder/windows-client).

### Clone the sample

1. Verify that the AppBuilder Windows client is running and you are logged in the Telerik Platform in the account in which you want to develop your application.

1. Provide an app name.
1. Click **Clone**.

A new app is added in your {{site.tp}} account and all files are checked into the integrated {{site.ab}} version control. Third-party version control is configured and your app is connected to the repository from which you cloned it. {{site.ab}} opens the code for your new app and lists all app files in the **Project Navigator**.

### Run the sample

With the AppBuilder Windows client, you can quickly test your apps on device, in the simulator or in the native emulators.

* [Run in the companion app.][companion]
* [Run in the native emulators.][emulators]
* [Deploy on device via QR code.][QR code]
* [Deploy via cable connection.][USB deploy]
